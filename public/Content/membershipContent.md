The Bungendore Brigade has an active membership, we offer two regular training opportunties a month and numerous specialised sessions every year.

It can take up to 12 months to be qualified to be a firefighter depending on the time of year and the scheduling of courses and assessments.

We encourage and welcome everyone to come down to the station on a Friday night from 7pm to join in our weekly truck and equipment maintenance to get a feel for the brigade and chat to our members before you formally apply.

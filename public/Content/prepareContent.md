### Bushfire Ready: Your 4-Step Action Plan

**Be Prepared. Stay Safe.** A well-prepared home and a solid plan give you the best chance against a bushfire.

> **1. TALK IT OUT: Plan Your Response**
> What will your household do if a bushfire threatens? Have the conversation now. Dinner time is a great time â€“ everyone's there and focused.

> **2. HOME PREP: Reduce Your Risk**
> Simple actions make a big difference. Keep grass short, clear debris, and ensure easy access around your home. Get your property bushfire ready!

> **3. KNOW THE ALERTS: Understand the Danger**
> Fire danger ratings and alert levels change. Check the NSW RFS website and the 'Fires Near Me' app regularly. Know what each alert means for you.

> **4. STAY INFORMED: Your Lifeline**
> During a fire, information is critical. Keep emergency numbers, official websites, and apps handy. Monitor conditions constantly.

**Don't wait!** A prepared home and a clear plan are your best defense.
